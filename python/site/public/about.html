    <h3>What is Advanced Targeting Computer?</h3>
    <p>
      Advanced Targeting Computer is a tournament data aggregation site for the
      X-Wing Miniatures Game. Data is taken from
      <a href="http://listfortress.com">Listfortress</a>, which is a
      crowdsourced collection of tournaments, players, and lists. AT.C tracks
      card performances by tournament as many other sites do, in addition to
      collecting information on specific matchups between pilots.
    </p>
    <p>
      AT.C is open source, with a public github repository available here: (Not
      published yet).
    </p>
    <p>
      Please report any issues you encounter or feature requests here: (Not
      published yet).
    </p>
    <h3>What data is used? How is it filtered?</h3>
    <p>
      Currently, data is used from tournaments in Listfortress with at least 20
      players, where 65% or more of players have lists entered that took place
      after the release of Wave 4: 10 July 2019. The is to prevent small events
      which tend to be uploaded consistently by the same geographic regions from
      being overrepresented, and to prevent swiss rankings and cut rates from
      being warped by events where only the lists that made the cut from
      appearing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Soonâ„¢, the date range will be modifiable so you can look into statistics
      for any period of Second Edition.
    </p>
    <h3>Help! What do these columns mean?</h3>
    <p>
      <strong>Lists</strong> signifies how many unique lists a pilot has
      appeared in. For unlimited/generic cards, this means that a list bringing
      four copies of the same card counts that card only once. For cards that
      are limited to one copy per list, this is a simple count of how many times
      that card has been used.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Avg Bid</strong> is the average (mean) bid of every list that
      includes the given card.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Avg Swiss Rank</strong> is the average (mean) final swiss result
      of every list including at least one copy of the given card, normalized by
      tournament size. The lower the percentage, the better the performance of
      the card. For example, an Avg Swiss Rank of 45 means the given card's
      average performance is 45th out of a 100 person event. Or, in a 200 person
      event, the average result would be 90 - in a 10 person event, 4.5th. When
      a player has 0 for their swiss rank, we treat that as last place in an
      event.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Cut Rate</strong> signifies what percentage of all lists
      containing the given card made the top cut at a given event.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Matches</strong> is the count of how many games with at least one
      copy of the given card have been played.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Wins</strong> is the percentage of all matches including this card
      that the list containing this card wins.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Bigger/Smaller Bid</strong> is the winrate for the selected pilot
      against the pilot row, when the opposing pilot in the table has a smaller
      or bigger bid. For example, when this was written Soontir Fel had a 52%
      winrate against Anakin Skywalker (Aethersprite), but with a larger bid
      Soontir wins 75% of the time, while with a smaller bid Soontir wins 37.5%
      of the time.
    </p>
    <h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
    <p><strong>Why is the average winrate not 50%?!</strong></p>
    <p>
      In general, lists tend to be missing from the bottom positions of an
      event. Because of this, the lists we do have matchup data for have an
      above 50% winrate in aggregate.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong
        >Why is nearly every pilots most commonly played opposing pilot a mirror
        match?</strong
      >
    </p>
    <p>
      When a pilot plays itself, there are two instances of that pilot playing.
      Since we have to include game A from player B and player C's perspective,
      we actually have two games played: one from player B, and one from player
      C. Because of this, they aren't actually playing game A - they're playing
      two games.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Why don't you filter out cards with small sample sizes?</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      While this might change in the future, information that a card isn't used
      very often is still valuable information, even if the aggregated
      information isn't useful in a given sample size.
